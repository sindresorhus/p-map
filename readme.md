# p-map

> Map over promises concurrently

Useful when you need to run promise-returning & async functions multiple times with different inputs concurrently.

This is different from `Promise.all()` in that you can control the concurrency and also decide whether or not to stop iterating when there's an error.

## Install

```
$ npm install p-map
```

## Usage

```js
import pMap from 'p-map';
import got from 'got';

const sites = [
	getWebsiteFromUsername('sindresorhus'), //=> Promise
	'https://avajs.dev',
	'https://github.com'
];

const mapper = async site => {
	const {requestUrl} = await got.head(site);
	return requestUrl;
};

const result = await pMap(sites, mapper, {concurrency: 2});

console.log(result);
//=> ['https://sindresorhus.com/', 'https://avajs.dev/', 'https://github.com/']
```

## API

### pMap(input, mapper, options?)

Returns a `Promise` that is fulfilled when all promises in `input` and ones returned from `mapper` are fulfilled, or rejects if any of the promises reject. The fulfilled value is an `Array` of the fulfilled values returned from `mapper` in `input` order.

#### input

Type: `AsyncIterable<Promise<unknown> | unknown> | Iterable<Promise<unknown> | unknown>`

Synchronous or asynchronous iterable that is iterated over concurrently, calling the `mapper` function for each element.  Each iterated item is `await`'d before the `mapper` is invoked so the iterable may return a `Promise` that resolves to an item.

Asynchoronous iterables (distinguishing from iterables that return `Promise` that resolves to an item) can be used when the next item may not be ready without waiting for an asynchronous process to complete and/or the end of the iterable may be reached after the asynchornous proces completes (e.g. reading from a remote queue when the queue has reached empty, or reading lines from a stream).

#### mapper(element, index)

Type: `Function`

Expected to return a `Promise` or value.

#### options

Type: `object`

##### concurrency

Type: `number` *(Integer)*\
Default: `Infinity`\
Minimum: `1`

Number of concurrently pending promises returned by `mapper`.

##### stopOnError

Type: `boolean`\
Default: `true`

When set to `false`, instead of stopping when a promise rejects, it will wait for all the promises to settle and then reject with an [aggregated error](https://github.com/sindresorhus/aggregate-error) containing all the errors from the rejected promises.

### pMapSkip

Return this value from a `mapper` function to skip including the value in the returned array.

```js
import pMap, {pMapSkip} from 'p-map';
import got from 'got';

const sites = [
	getWebsiteFromUsername('sindresorhus'), //=> Promise
	'https://avajs.dev',
	'https://example.invalid',
	'https://github.com'
];

const mapper = async site => {
	try {
		const {requestUrl} = await got.head(site);
		return requestUrl;
	} catch {
		return pMapSkip;
	}
};

const result = await pMap(sites, mapper, {concurrency: 2});

console.log(result);
//=> ['https://sindresorhus.com/', 'https://avajs.dev/', 'https://github.com/']
```
